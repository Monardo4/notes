<a href = "https://scratch.mit.edu/users/chickenpotpie234/" target = "_self">Scratch</a>
	<br/>
	Scratch is a basic drag and drop coding site that is used for education in the basics of coding.  
	<br/>
	I have a few projects from a few years ago, and I occasionally will program something in it, because it is so simple.
	<br/>
	<br/>
<a href = "https://github.com/Monardo4" target = "_self">Github</a>
	<br/>
	Github is a place where you can store your code using git, and access it anywhere.
	<br/>
	This is where I store my more serious projects, and most of my current code.
	<br/>
	<br/>
<a href = "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8Rhqm5mXhVrYVSqC06dNzQ/featured" target = "_self">Youtube</a>
	<br/>
	Youtube is google's video sharing site, but you probably know that.
	<br/>
	I make short films, mostly stop motion animation, and I post here about once a week.
	<br/>
	<br/>
<a href = "https://3box.io/0xccb90283d816dc38175368ba8b1242933fee8083/wall" target = "_self">3Box</a>
	<br/>
	3Box is a setup for dapps on ethereum, it acts to streamline one's information across services.
	<br/>
	This is my 3Box profile, so if you want any information about that, you can go here, and use it.
	<br/>
	<br/>
<a href = "https://etherscan.io/address/0xccb90283d816dc38175368ba8b1242933fee8083" target = "_self">Ethereum</a>
	<br/>
	Ethereum is the second largest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin, and it can run several smaller tokens, and apps on it's own.
	<br/>
	This is my Ethereum Wallet Address, so if you want to send me any Ether, or other tokens, use this.
	<br/>

<br/>
	Dogecoin is a joke cryptocurrency that is just a currency and a joke.
	<br/>
	I have a Doge wallet just because I can, and if you want to send me anything, just do so here.
	<br/>
	<br/>
<a href = "https://peepeth.com/Monardo" target = "_self">Peepeth</a>
	<br/>
	Peepeth is like twitter, but it runs on the ethereum blockchain.  
	<br/>
	I use it like twitter, and just kind of write things occasionally.
		<br/>
	<br/>
<a href = "https://discord.gg/yNCTdXDtmb" target = "_self">Discord</a>
	<br/>
	Discord is a messaging thing, and you can set up servers to talk to other people.  Lots of people use it.
	<br/>
	If you want to contact me, go to this discord server, or DM me once you have entered the server.  This is pretty much the main way to contact me.
